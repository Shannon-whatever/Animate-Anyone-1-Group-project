# APAI3010 Group Project - Reproduction and Extensions of Animate Anyone

## Description:
This repository serves as the official codebase for the APAI3010 course group project, dedicated to rigorously reproducing the results of the seminal paper Animate Anyone: Consistent and Controllable Image-to-Video Synthesis for Character Animation ([original work cited here](https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone/)). Building upon the paper's core methodology, our team further explores targeted extensions and improvements to enhance its robustness, efficiency, or applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Group Members:
- Li Ka Lam (u3605873@connect.hku.hk)
- Chen Shiyang (whatever@connect.hku.hk)
- Chechneva Kseniia ()
  
## Key Components:

### Reproduction:

- Faithfully reimplemented the authors' framework using [PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX], validated against benchmark datasets.
- Conducted ablation studies to verify critical design choices and hyperparameters.
- Provided pre-trained models, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive documentation to ensure reproducibility.

### Extensions & Innovations:

- Algorithmic Enhancements: Introduced [specific improvements, e.g., "a temporal coherence module to reduce frame flickering" or "an adaptive pose encoder for sparse input handling"].
- Performance Optimization: Streamlined inference pipelines, achieving a [X]% reduction in computational overhead while maintaining visual fidelity.
- Novel Applications: Explored adaptations for [specific use cases, e.g., "real-time animation" or "cross-domain stylization"].

## Contributions:

- Delivered a modular, well-documented codebase to support academic and industrial research in human animation.
- Published quantitative/qualitative comparisons between original and extended results, highlighting trade-offs and advancements.
- Provided actionable insights for future work at the intersection of pose estimation and generative models.

## Collaboration:
We welcome feedback, issue reports, and constructive dialogue from the community. For course-related inquiries, please contact u3605873@connect.hku.hk.
