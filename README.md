# APAI3010 Group Project - Animate Anyone: Reproduction, Analysis, and Extensions

## Description:
This repository contains our reproduction, analysis, and extension of the Animate Anyone pose-driven character animation framework. We reproduced the model using Moore Threadsâ€™ unofficial implementation, evaluated its performance on standard benchmarks and a custom dataset, and explored extensions to improve facial animation. Our work highlights both the strengths and limitations of the current state-of-the-art in image-to-video character animation.

## Key Components:

### Reproduction:

- Faithfully reimplemented the authors' framework using [PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX], validated against benchmark datasets.
- Conducted ablation studies to verify critical design choices and hyperparameters.
- Provided pre-trained models, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive documentation to ensure reproducibility.

### Extensions & Innovations:

- Algorithmic Enhancements: Introduced [specific improvements, e.g., "a temporal coherence module to reduce frame flickering" or "an adaptive pose encoder for sparse input handling"].
- Performance Optimization: Streamlined inference pipelines, achieving a [X]% reduction in computational overhead while maintaining visual fidelity.
- Novel Applications: Explored adaptations for [specific use cases, e.g., "real-time animation" or "cross-domain stylization"].

## Contributions:

- Delivered a modular, well-documented codebase to support academic and industrial research in human animation.
- Published quantitative/qualitative comparisons between original and extended results, highlighting trade-offs and advancements.
- Provided actionable insights for future work at the intersection of pose estimation and generative models.

## Collaboration:
We welcome feedback, issue reports, and constructive dialogue from the community. For course-related inquiries, please contact u3605873@connect.hku.hk.
